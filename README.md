# consul-monitor

Ongoing Development (Discovery of [consul](https://www.consul.io/))

* This is a monitoring service.
* It serves only to alert when there is a problem.
* It does not keep a browsable history (of graphs) for further analysis.

See `system/README` for system setup (consul, deployment of __this__)
